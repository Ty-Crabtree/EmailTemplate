<p>It can also be helpful to think of this ratio the other way around, asking the question: <strong>How many tests does it take to find one case?</strong></p>

<p>Here we show the share of tests returning a positive result ‚Äì known as the positive rate.</p>
<p>This metric offers us two key insights: firstly as<strong> </strong>a measure of <em>how adequately countries are testing</em>; and secondly <em>to help us understand the spread of the virus</em>, in conjunction with data on confirmed cases.¬†</p>
<p>The positive rate is a good metric for how adequately countries are testing because it indicates the level of testing relative to the size of the outbreak. To be able to properly monitor and control the spread of the virus, countries with more widespread outbreaks need to do more testing.</p>
<p>According to criteria published by WHO in May 2020, a positive rate of less than 5% is one indicator that the epidemic is under control in a country.<a class="ref" href="#note-1" id="ref-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Because limited testing makes it likely that many cases will be missed, the positive rate can also help our understanding of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#what-is-the-global-situation-now">the spread of the virus</a>. In countries with a high positive rate, the number of confirmed cases is likely to represent only a small fraction of the true number of infections. And where the positive rate is rising in a country, this can suggest the virus is actually spreading faster than the growth seen in confirmed cases.</p>

<p>This scatter chart provides another way of seeing the extent of testing relative to the scale of the outbreak in different countries.</p>
<p>The chart shows the daily number of tests (vertical axis) against the daily number of new confirmed cases (horizontal axis), per million people.</p>
<p>Looking down the chart, we see some countries doing ten or hundred times fewer tests than other countries with a similar number of new confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Conversely, looking to the right, we see some countries find ten or a hundred times more cases than others out of a similar number of tests.</p>
<p>Where the number of confirmed cases is high relative to the extent of testing, this suggests that there may not be enough tests  being carried out to properly monitor the outbreak. In such countries, the true number of infections may be far higher than the number of confirmed cases.</p>

<p>This chart shows the number of¬†<em>daily</em>¬†tests per thousand people. Because the number of tests is often volatile from day to day, we show the figures as a seven-day rolling average. </p>
<h5>What is counted as a test?</h5>
<p>The number of tests does not refer to the same in each country ‚Äì one difference is that some countries report the number of people tested, while others report the number of tests performed (which can be higher if the same person is tested more than once). And other countries report their testing data in a way that leaves it unclear what the test count refers to exactly.</p>
<p>We indicate the differences in the chart and explain them in detail in our accompanying¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#source-information-country-by-country" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">source descriptions</a>.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at the extent of testing relative to the scale of the outbreak is to ask: <strong>How many tests does a country do to find one COVID-19 case?</strong></p>
<p>It is simply the inverse of our data on the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/positive-rate-daily-smoothed">positive rate</a>.</p>
<p>Countries that do very few tests per confirmed case are unlikely to be testing widely enough to find all cases. The WHO has suggested around 10 ‚Äì 30 tests per confirmed case as a general benchmark of adequate testing.<a class="ref" href="#note-2" id="ref-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>This chart plots the total number of tests performed per thousand people against GDP per capita. We see that richer countries in general have done more testing.</p>
<p>The differences in the extent of testing between rich and poor countries is large. While poorer countries such as Cote d‚ÄôIvoire and Nigeria have done only a few tests per thousand people, richer countries like Australia, Denmark and the United Arab Emirates have done more tests than there are people in the country.</p>

Clear answers to these questions are what is needed to properly interpret and compare published numbers.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="our-checklist-of-questions-to-understand-testing-data"><a class="deep-link" href="#our-checklist-of-questions-to-understand-testing-data"></a>Our checklist of questions to understand testing data</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p><strong>1) Is there no data ‚Äì or it is just hard to find?</strong></p><p>Many countries are not yet providing official figures. Others do not do so on a regular basis. The first question to ask, then, is if there is any testing data for a given country.</p><p>Equally important is to make the available data findable. Currently, the available data is often not easy to find, because some countries are releasing figures at unpredictable intervals in ad-hoc locations (including social media or press conferences).</p><p><strong>2)</strong> <strong>What testing technologies are being used?</strong></p><p>There are many different technologies for COVID-19 testing, some of which are already implemented, some currently available but not yet rolled out, and some still in development.¬† As we discuss¬†<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#different-types-of-tests-for-covid-19">here</a>, these different tests are used with different objectives in mind, and there are technical differences in how results from these different testing technologies should be interpreted.¬†</p><p>It‚Äôs critical that¬†governments provide a detailed and explicit account of the technologies that are being implemented as they get rolled out, disaggregating the test results accordingly. For citizens to trust and understand the published data, and for epidemiologists to incorporate the data into the models that inform public policy, it is crucial that every country provides the data on testing in a clearly documented way.</p><p><strong>3) Do numbers refer to ‚Äòperformed tests‚Äô or ‚Äòindividuals tested‚Äô?</strong></p><p>The number of tests performed is different to the number of individuals tested. The reason for this is that it is common for COVID-19 testing that the same person is tested more than once.</p><p>Some countries report tests performed, while others report the number of individuals tested. In the latter case, it needs to be clear if people who undergo multiple rounds of testing (for instance because they suspected they were infected in March, and then again in September) are counted per round of testing, or only once.</p><p>The data description should state clearly what is counted.</p><p><strong>4) Are negative results included? Are pending results included?</strong></p><p>It needs to be clear whether or not figures for the total number of tests performed, or the number of people tested, include negative test results, as well as the number of tests that are pending results.</p><p>Many sources report the number of individuals who are ‚Äòsuspected‚Äô or have been ‚Äòruled out‚Äô. To be reliably included in test counts, it needs to be explicit whether such categories reflect the number of people who are awaiting test results or have tested negatively.</p><p><strong>5) Do the figures include all tests conducted in the country, or only some?¬†</strong></p><p>Figures reported by countries may only be partial if not all laboratories are reporting to the central authority.</p><p>The scope of testing data should be made explicit by the source.</p><p><strong>6) Are all regions and laboratories within a country submitting data on the same basis?</strong></p><p>Answers to the questions above may vary from region to region. In order to assess the reliability of aggregate testing data, it needs to be clear if heterogenous data is being summed together.</p><p>The <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/">US COVID Tracking Project</a>, for instance makes it clear that their US totals combine data for tests performed and individuals tested, depending on which is reported by individual states.</p><p><strong>7) What period do the published figures refer to?</strong></p><p>Cumulative counts of the total number of tests should make clear the date from which the count begins. The key question that needs to be answered is whether the figures published at some date (attempt to) include all tests conducted up to that date.</p><p>Because the reporting of tests can take several days, for some countries figures for the last few days may not yet be complete. It needs to be made clear by the source if this may be the case. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Ftesting-in-us.html">US CDC</a>, for instance, makes this clear.</p><p><strong>8) Are there any issues that affect the comparability of the data over time?</strong></p><p>If we want to look at how testing figures are changing over time, we need to know how any of the factors discussed above may have changed too.</p><p><a href="https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus/covid-19/informatie-voor-professionals/virologische-dagstaten">The </a><a href="https://www.rivm.nl/archief-weekrapportages-covid-19-in-nederland">Netherlands</a>, for instance, makes it clear that not all labs were included in national estimates from the start. As new labs get included, their past cumulative total gets added to the day they begin reporting, creating spikes in the time series.</p><p><strong>9) What are the typical testing practices in the country?</strong></p><p>Having a sense of how often and when individuals are tested, can help the users of these statistics understand how estimates of tests performed and individuals tested might relate to each other.</p><p>For instance, how many tests does a case investigation require? What are the eligibility criteria to be tested? Are health workers, or other specific groups, being routinely retested?</p><p><strong>10) Might any of the information above be lost in translation?</strong></p><p>People accessing data published in a language in which they are not fluent may misinterpret the data by mistranslating the provided text, which often includes technical terms.</p><p>Many countries report testing data in multiple languages ‚Äì this helps disseminate the information to a broader audience, whilst helping prevent misinterpretations.<br/>Ôªø</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>

number of tests performed, so we assume that the discrepancy is due to ambiguous language and translation issues.<br/><br/>Testing figures refer to PCR and antigen tests.

Serological tests are also performed in Albania for ‚Äúscreening purposes‚Äù (‚Äúp<u+00eb>r arsye depistimi‚Äù), meaning that positive results are not used to confirm cases of COVID-19, and so they are excluded from our testing figures to ensure the accuracy of our Positive Rate. In reports from 10 Nov to 6 Dec 2020, testing figures refer to the total number of tests, and specifcy the number of which that are ‚Äòfor screening purposes‚Äô; in such instances, we report the difference between these two figures in order to exclude serological tests.

Because of this, the cumulative number of tests went from 3,919,571 on 11 January to 6,865,442 on 12 January. More similar additions were made later in January.<br/><br/>The definition of the tests in this dataset was changed on 13 January 2021 to include both antigen and PCR tests. Because historical testing data was added on that date, the timeline cannot be used for continuous calculations. Like most Austrian media outlets and scientific institutions, we have therefore changed our test positive rate calculations to only include data from February 2021 onwards.<br/><br/>Austria has been testing at a high rate: both PCR and antigen tests are available for free, regardless of COVID symptoms, and testing is compulsory for school children and for accessing many services. Due to this very high number of tests in the denominator, this results in a positive rate that is very low.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="azerbaijan"><a class="deep-link" href="#azerbaijan"></a>Azerbaijan</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">‚Üí View <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-country-by-country?country=AZE">the country profile of Azerbaijan</a> for the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><a href="https://koronavirusinfo.az/az/page/statistika/azerbaycanda-cari-veziyyet">Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan</a></p><p><strong>Short description: </strong>The number of tests performed</p><p><strong>Test definition: </strong>PCR</p><p><strong>Case definition: </strong>PCR</p><p><strong>Positive rate: </strong>calculated by Our World in Data as the 7-day rolling average of daily cases, divided by the 7-day rolling average of daily tests.</p><p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br/>The Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan provides <a href="https://koronavirusinfo.az/az/page/statistika/azerbaycanda-cari-veziyyet">daily snapshots</a> that report the cumulative number of tests performed to date. <br/><br/>Antigen tests are not used to diagnose cases of COVID-19, according to an [article]https://www.turan.az/ext/news/2020/12/free/politics%20news/en/131079.htm) published by Turan Information Agency on 20 Dec 2020.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="bahrain"><a class="deep-link" href="#bahrain"></a>Bahrain</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">‚Üí View <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-country-by-country?country=BHR">the country profile of Bahrain</a> for the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><a href="https://healthalert.gov.bh/en/">Bahrain Ministry of Health</a></p><p><strong>Short description: </strong>It is unclear whether the number of tests refers to samples or individuals tested.</p><p><strong>Test definition: </strong>PCR</p><p><strong>Case definition: </strong>PCR</p><p><strong>Positive rate: </strong>calculated by Our World in Data as the 7-day rolling average of daily cases, divided by the 7-day rolling average of daily tests.</p><p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br/>The Bahrainian Ministry of Health publishes frequent updates on the number of confirmed cases, status of existing cases and number of assessments conducted.<br/><br/>These figures refer to the number of cumulative PCR tests to that given date.

Data is available from 6 March 2020.<br/><br/>Prior to 24 July 2020, suspected COVID-19 cases in Costa Rica could only be confirmed via a positive PCR test result, as described in the 12 June 2020 national <a href="https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/sobre_ministerio/prensa/docs/lineamientos_nacionales_vigilancia_infeccion_coronavirus_12062020_v14_vf.pdf">guidelines</a> for COVID-19 surveillance. However, revised <a href="https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/sobre_ministerio/prensa/docs/lineamientos_nacionales_vigilancia_infeccion_coronavirus_v15_24072020.pdf">guidelines</a> published on 24 July 2020 expand the definition of a confirmed COVID-19 case to allow for cases to be confirmed without a PCR test, by epidemiological link.<br/><br/>In the dataset, ‚Äúnue_posi‚Äù refers to ‚Äúdaily positive cases‚Äù (‚ÄúNuevos casos diarios positivos por COVID-19‚Äù), ‚Äúconf_nexo‚Äù refers to ‚Äúdaily positive cases confirmed by epidemiological link‚Äù (‚ÄúNuevos casos diarios positivos por COVID-19 confirmados por nexo epidemiol<u+00f3>gico‚Äù), and ‚Äúnue_descar‚Äù refers to ‚Äúdaily cases whose laboratory tests were negative‚Äù (‚ÄúNuevos casos diarios cuyos ex<u+00e1>menes de laboratorio dieron negativo‚Äù). We subtract ‚Äúconf_nexo‚Äù from ‚Äúnue_posi‚Äù to determine the number of daily cases confirmed by a positive laboratory test. We then add this value to ‚Äúnue_descar‚Äù to determine the total number of daily people tested by PCR test. We also estimate the Positive Rate by dividing the 7-day average of daily cases confirmed by a positive PCR test by the 7-day average of daily people tested by PCR test.<br/><br/>On 29 Jan 2021, ‚Äúthe Ministry of Health endorsed the acquisition and use of antigen tests‚Äù in 10 laboratories, according to <a href="https://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/index.php/centro-de-prensa/noticias/746-noticias-2021/2042-laboratorios-con-aval-de-salud-para-realizar-pruebas-de-antigeno-de-sars-cov-2?fbclid=IwAR3c0c_YI28AnSjIsCdP1kOczUcE_cVYghZ9c7SjRFauCSQ540eIjkddzPE">this article</a>.

From 24 March to 6 May 2020, testing figures were reported in terms of ‚Äútests performed‚Äù (e.g. ‚ÄúDosad je obavljeno ukupno 3.159 testiranja‚Äù). Since 6 May 2020 they have been reported in terms of ‚Äúpeople tested‚Äù (e.g. ‚ÄúDosad je testirano ukupno 41.053 osoba‚Äù). It does not appear that this change in terminology reflects a substantive change in the figures that are reported, however, since there were no large breaks in the time series coinciding with these changes in terminology.<br/><br/>On 1 November 2020, the Minister of Health announced in a <a href="https://vlada.gov.hr/vijesti/beros-od-utorka-brzi-antigenski-testovi-uskoro-novo-serolosko-testiranje/30740">press release</a> that antigen and antibody tests will be used ‚Äúto determine how many people in Croatia were in contact with the virus‚Äù. However, it is unclear if antigen and antibody tests will be included in testing figures, or if positive results from these tests will be included in confirmed case figures.<br/><br/>The source provides data for both the cumulative number of people tested to date and the number of people tested in the last 24 hours. The daily change in the cumulative number of people tested to date equals the number of people tested in the last 24 hours, suggesting that the cumulative total will repeatedly count people that have undergone more than one round of testing over the course of the pandemic.

The set also includes the number of tests according to the indication (diagnostic indications, epidemiological indications, preventive and comprehensive testing, others), positive results according to the test indication and positive results according to the test type.

This positive rate is calculated based on PCR and antigen tests (rather than only PCR) because our source for confirmed cases (Johns Hopkins University) includes the positive results of antigen tests in the count of daily confirmed cases in Czechia.

Data is available from 17 March 2020.<br/><br/>Between 10 and 26 May 2020, the daily situation updates provide figures for both the number of samples tested and the number of persons tested. Over this period the two figures differ from one another by exactly 981 tests on each day, which is due to persons under mandatory quarantine undergoing multiple test (2,022 samples tested on 1,041 persons). This discrepancy of 981 tests is small, representing less than 1% of cumulative samples tested at the time. In contrast, the cumulative number of samples tested through routine surveillance and contact tracing are exactly equal to the cumulative number of persons tested on each day in these respective categories. <br/><br/>Prior to 10 May 2020, the daily situation updates provide testing figures using inconsistent terminology, varying between ‚Äúsamples tested‚Äù, ‚Äúpersons tested‚Äù, ‚Äúsuspected cases tested‚Äù, and similar language. Nevertheless, we choose to include all of these figures within our constructed time series, since the variation in terminology does not appear to correspond to large breaks in the time series. In addition, based on the fact that the number of samples tested differs only slightly from the number of persons tested over the 10 May to 26 May 2020 period, we have no reason to believe that the variation in terminology prior to 10 May has any serious ramifications for the interpretation of the time series as the cumulative number of samples tested. From 10 May 2020 onwards, the daily situation updates consistently report the cumulative number of samples tested. <br/><br/>No further information is provided about the reported testing numbers, such as whether they include pending or non-PCR tests.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="greece"><a class="deep-link" href="#greece"></a>Greece</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">‚Üí View <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-country-by-country?country=GRC">the country profile of Greece</a> for the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><a href="https://eody.gov.gr/category/covid-19">Hellenic National Public Health Organization</a></p><p><strong>Short description: </strong>The number of samples tested.</p><p><strong>Test definition: </strong>PCR + antigen</p><p><strong>Case definition: </strong>PCR + antigen</p><p><strong>Positive rate: </strong>calculated by Our World in Data as the 7-day rolling average of daily cases, divided by the 7-day rolling average of daily tests.</p><p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br/>The Hellenic National Organization of Public Health publishes daily COVID-19 <a href="https://eody.gov.gr/category/covid-19/">press releases</a> detailing the number of confirmed cases, deaths and samples tested to date since 1 January 2020.

However, the wording used in some tweets and press releases makes it unclear whether the figures relate to the number of samples tested or the number of people tested. For example, the relevant tweet on <a href="https://twitter.com/MOH_Kenya/status/1268563481235787776">4 June 2020</a> says ‚Äú2,640 samples tested in the last 24 hours‚Äù, while the relevant tweet on <a href="https://twitter.com/MOH_Kenya/status/1289552051916009475">1 August 2020</a> states that ‚Äú727 people are the latest to test positive for Covid-19 from a sample of 6,371 tested in the last 24 hrs‚Äù. It does not appear that this inconsistency in terminology reflects a substantive change in the figures that are reported, since there are no large breaks in the time series that correspond to the use of ‚Äúsamples tested‚Äù versus ‚Äúpeople tested‚Äù terminology. Instead, the wording of the tweets and press releases suggests that the reported number of samples tested may be equivalent to the number of people tested.

Instead, it reports the number of tests in the last 24 hours and the cumulative number of tests.<br/><br/>There are reports published prior to the 28 March (the earliest we could find is dated 18 March 2020) that include the number of positive and negative tests conducted by the National Institute of Health or in private laboratories. However, the cumulative totals for 26 and 27 March 2020 are inconsistent with the cumulative total reported for the 28 March 2020 onwards.

We were alerted by a Technical Advisor within the Cabinet of the Secretary of Health to the fact that these figures only captures people who were reported through the National System of Epidemiological Surveillance which does not include many of the people that get tested but are never entered into the surveillance system (because they do not meet the criteria and go on to test negatively). For this reason we have now switched to the current series. The advisor confirmed to us that this series: includes all the public, private and university labs performing SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in Portugal; does not include tests pending results.<br/><br/>Since October 2020, rapid antigen tests are also being performed for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in Portugal. Since positive results from these antigen tests are notified and counted in daily national figures for confirmed cases, we include them in the number of tests performed in the country. Some laboratories are performing PCR confirmatory tests on both negative and positive antigen tests.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="qatar"><a class="deep-link" href="#qatar"></a>Qatar</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">‚Üí View <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-country-by-country?country=QAT">the country profile of Qatar</a> for the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><a href="https://www.data.gov.qa/pages/dashboard-covid-19-cases-in-qatar/">Qatar Open Data Portal</a></p><p><strong>Short description: </strong>The number of people tested.</p><p><strong>Positive rate: </strong>calculated by Our World in Data as the 7-day rolling average of daily cases, divided by the 7-day rolling average of daily tests.</p><p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br/>The Qatar Open Data Portal publishes a daily time series of the cumulative number of tests performed to date.

The bulletins extend back to 13 February 2020 and ceased on 15 October 2021. The Ministry of Health now sporadically shares testing data on their <a href="https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/">website</a>. We cannot say with certainty when testing began, only that 856 samples had been tested as of 13 February 2020.<br/><br/>We have been unable to find testing figures in any of the bulletins published between 29 April 2020 and 28 July 2020, with the exception of a 4 July 2020 bulletin reporting that 379,701 samples had been tested to date. From 29 July 2020 onwards, the bulletins make it clear that the testing figures relate to PCR tests only.<br/><br/>Some bulletins report the cumulative number of people tested alongside the cumulative number of samples tested. Oddly, the cumulative number of people tested is larger than the cumulative number of samples tested. For example, <a href="http://vncdc.gov.vn/vi/phong-chong-dich-benh-viem-phoi-cap-ncov/14061/ban-tin-cap-nhat-dich-benh-covid-19-ngay-18-9-2020">the 18 September 2020 bulletin</a> reports 1,183,341 samples tested to date using PCR, while at the same time reporting 1,358,575 people tested to date. Further, a 15 March 2021 <a href="https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/web/guest/-/6847912-112">press statement</a> reports 2,482,302 RT-PCR tests as well as 3,248,873 people tested. The article also states that ‚Äúthe number of rooms capable of testing for ‚Ä¶ SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR technique is 157 rooms, the maximum testing capacity is about 62,593 samples / day‚Äù, while ‚Äúthe number of rooms that have been allowed for confirmed testing is 101 rooms with a maximum testing capacity of about 50,663 samples per day.‚Äù In another <a href="https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/web/guest/-/6847912-109">article</a>, it is stated that ‚Äúin case of suspected positive, positive must immediately transfer the sample to the laboratory that has been allowed to test confirm SARS-CoV-2‚Äù. As such, one explanation for this discrepancy is that samples are tested multiple times.<br/><br/>Bulletins published between 13 February 2020 and 28 April 2020 report the cumulative number of samples tested to date alongside the cumulative number of samples with positive test results and the cumulative number of samples with negative test results, which suggests that in this time period the total number of samples tested may be equivalent to the number of people tested. However, it is unclear whether samples with negative test results include instances of resampling for the same person.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="zambia"><a class="deep-link" href="#zambia"></a>Zambia</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">‚Üí View <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-country-by-country?country=ZMB">the country profile of Zambia</a> for the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><a href="https://zambia-open-data-nsdi-mlnr.hub.arcgis.com/pages/zambia-covid19">Zambia Ministry of Health</a></p><p><strong>Short description: </strong>The number of tests performed.</p><p><strong>Positive rate: </strong>calculated by Our World in Data as the 7-day rolling average of daily cases, divided by the 7-day rolling average of daily tests.</p><p><strong>Detailed description:</strong><br/>The Zambia Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, in collaboration with the Zambia Statistics Agency, provides a time series of the number of samples tested each day since 19 March 2020 in an <a href="https://zambia-open-data-nsdi-mlnr.hub.arcgis.com/pages/zambia-covid19">official dashboard</a>.<br/><br/>The dashboard data is sourced from daily reports produced by the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.zm/">Ministry of Health</a> (published on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mohzambia">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mohzambia">Twitter</a> pages) and the <a href="https://znphi.co.zm/news/situation-reports-new-coronavirus-covid-19-sitreps">Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI)</a>. <br/><br/>To ensure accuracy, we have cross-checked a sample of the dashboard figures against the Ministry of Health and ZNPHI reports.<br/><br/>Official reports from the Ministry of Health and ZNPHI use the terminology ‚Äútests conducted‚Äù and ‚Äúsamples tested‚Äù interchangeably over time, with no indication that the choice of terminology represents a substantive difference in the reported figures.<br/><br/>The reported figures that are based on ZNPHI reports exclude pending test results, while it is unclear whether the reported figures from the Ministry of Health reports exclude pending test results.
